#Baseball

Maybe my most passionate area of interest is in baseball. I've been watching baseball since my St. Louis Cardinals won it all in 2011 in a stunning upset over the Texas Rangers. In that World Series Game 6, David Freese hit a game tying triple in the bottom of the 9th after being down to his last strike in what would've been the end of the World Series with the Rangers hoisting the trophy. Then after a stunning couple of extra innings that saw back and forth scoring, David Freese would ultimately step up to the plate again in the 11th with the game tied, and hit **one of the most iconic walkoff homeruns of all time** to send the series to a must win Game 7 that the Cardinals would ultimately go on to win. From that day on, baseball has been and always will hold a large part of my heart.
