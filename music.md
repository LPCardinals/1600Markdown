# *Music*

I'm an avid lister of music, and I'm passionate about a certain genre in particular. I've grown up listening to my dad's music, which mostly consists of classic rock, and that love for classic rock has never left me. I've been to concerts for groups and individuals alike, from Foreigner to Billy Joel. Classic rock is certainly not the genre of choice for most of my generation, but for the few of who do still adore that old kind of rock and roll it holds a special place in our hearts. That being said though, different polls show that as much as 80% of people still listen to rock even just on occassion: [Article Here](https://www.insideradio.com/rock-is-on-a-roll-as-ratings-and-music-consumption-show-growth/article_d0ba997a-aead-11e9-aad8-bf34f42901be.html) so maybe rock isn't dead just yet.
