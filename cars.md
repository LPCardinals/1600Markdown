# Cars

Cars are a big passion for me and have been for many years. I currently drive a little 2008 Mazda Miata, and it's a ton of fun throwing the top down and blasting down some back country roads. Electric cars are beginning to phase out the combustion engine, and while I think this is certainly a net positive for the enviroment I can say personally I'll be hanging on to my little 4 banger for as long as possible, because there's nothing like a healthy exaust note whe you're out on a spirited drive.
